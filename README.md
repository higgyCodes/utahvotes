# VAN Population Profiler
## Soon to be a generic open source application
This application will graphically interpret and display data from TXT files that have been exported from the Voter Activation Network database.
While the primary goal of the project is for use within Utah, the hope is that it will be easily adaptable for other states.
Goals for the project include:
1.  Creating maps that geographically situate populations using heatmaps and shapefiles.
2.  Making a print ready format so that the template is easily presentable.
3.  Adding in graphically analysis of precincts, state districts and congressional districts.
